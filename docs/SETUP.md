# Setup

How to set up the Tracelet monorepo on your machine.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ (20+ recommended)
- **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm** (use one consistently)

---

## Clone and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd tracelet
```

Install dependencies from the **repository root**:

```bash
npm install
# or: yarn install
# or: pnpm install
```

This installs dependencies for all workspaces (`packages/*`, `examples/*`).

## Next steps

- [Build packages](./BUILD.md) – compile SDKs and docs UI
- [Run locally](./RUNNING-LOCALLY.md) – start the app and docs UI
- [Project layout](./PROJECT-LAYOUT.md) – repository structure
