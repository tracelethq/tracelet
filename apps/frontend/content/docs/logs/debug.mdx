The **debug** option controls whether the Logger prints **debug and app-level** messages to the console and how verbose the output is. It does not change what is written to the log file; file logging is controlled by **logFilePath**.

## What `debug` does

| When `debug` is `false` (default) | When `debug` is `true` |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| Only **HTTP** request/response logs are printed to the console (when in local environment). | **All** log levels are printed: `logger.debug()`, `logger.info()`, `logger.warn()`, `logger.error()`, and HTTP logs. |
| App-level calls like `logger.info("Processing…")` are still written to the **log file** (if `logFilePath` is set) but not to the console. | Same app-level and HTTP logs are written to the log file; in addition, they are printed to the console with level prefixes (`[DEBUG]`, `[INFO]`, etc.) and pretty-printed JSON in local environment. |

So **debug** only affects **console** visibility of non-HTTP logs. Use it in development when you want to see `logger.debug()` and `logger.info()` output in the terminal without opening the Logs UI or tailing the file.

## How to set it

### Express

```typescript
tracelet({
  app,
  debug: true, // optional; default false
});
```

### Core

```typescript
const core = new TraceletCore({
  debug: true, // optional; default false
});
const { logger } = core.start();
```

## When to use it

- **Local development** – Set `debug: true` to see app and debug messages in the console alongside HTTP logs. Helps with troubleshooting without switching to the Logs UI.
- **Production or staging** – Leave `debug: false` (default) to avoid noisy console output. Rely on the log file and Logs UI (or your log aggregator) for inspection.

In the terminal you’ll see a **trace ID** (e.g. `[trace:abc-123]`) for each request. Use that same ID in the Logs UI (search or scan the trace column) to find the corresponding log entry and inspect the full request/response details.

## Summary

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `debug` | `false` | When `true`, app-level and debug logs are printed to the console (in addition to being written to the log file when `logFilePath` is set). HTTP logs are always printed in local environment regardless of `debug`. |
