The **Details** tab in the API tester shows the **documentation for the current route** — everything that comes from route meta (in code or `tracelet.doc.json`). Use it to see the route description, parameters, and expected response shapes before or after sending a request.

### What you see

| Section | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Route description** | The `description` from route meta: what the endpoint does (e.g. "Get a user by ID", "Create a new order"). |
| **Parameters** | Path and query parameters: name, type, required/optional, and a short description. Matches what you fill in the [Params](/docs/api-explorer/params) tab. |
| **Response types** | Expected response shapes from route meta (e.g. 200 vs 400). Each status can list properties (name, type, description). This is the *documented* shape, not the live response — the **Response** panel shows the actual body after you click **Send**. |

### How route meta drives the response section: `responses`

The **Response types** section in the Details tab comes from the **`responses`** field in route meta. It describes the expected response **per status code**, so you can see what the API is supposed to return for 200, 201, 400, 404, etc.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `status` | `number` | Yes | HTTP status code (e.g. 200, 201, 404). |
| `description` | `string` | No | Description of this response. |
| `properties` | `TraceletProperty[]` | No | List of properties in the response body. |

### TraceletProperty

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Yes | Property name. |
| `type` | `string` | Yes | Type name: e.g. `"string"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`, `"object"`, `"array"`, `"enum"`, `"file"`. |
| `desc` | `string` | No | Human-readable description. |
| `required` | `boolean` | No | Whether the field is required. |
| `enum` | `string[]` | No | When `type` is `"enum"`, the list of allowed values. |
| `accept` | `string` | No | When `type` is `"file"`: allowed file types (e.g. `"image/*"`, `".pdf"`, `"application/json"`). Same as HTML `input` [accept](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/file#accept). |
| `maxFiles` | `number` | No | When `type` is `"file"`: maximum number of files (default `1`). Use `> 1` to allow multiple file upload in the Try-it UI. |

This is **documentation only** — it does not change what the server actually returns. After you click **Send**, the **Response** panel shows the real status, body, and headers. Use the Details tab to compare: e.g. "the docs say 200 returns `id`, `email`, `name`; did the live response include all of them?"

**Example in route meta (JSON):**

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/users/:id",
  "responses": [
    {
      "status": 200,
      "description": "User object",
      "properties": [
        { "name": "id", "type": "string", "desc": "User ID" },
        { "name": "email", "type": "string", "desc": "Email address" },
        { "name": "name", "type": "string", "desc": "Display name" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "status": 404,
      "description": "User not found",
      "properties": []
    }
  ]
}
```

With this meta, the Details tab shows **Response types** for 200 (with `id`, `email`, `name`) and 404 (with no properties). The actual response body is always shown in the **Response** panel after you send a request.
