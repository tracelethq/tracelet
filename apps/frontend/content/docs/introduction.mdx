Tracelet helps backend developers get **request-level visibility** and **live API documentation** in minutes, without heavy observability setup or external services.

## What is Tracelet?

Tracelet is a **runtime API observability layer** for Node.js backends (starting with Express). It gives you:

- **Structured logging** – Request IDs, tracing IDs, method, route, status, duration, and response size. All created and formatted in one place so framework code stays thin.
- **Live API docs** – One JSON config (or in-code meta) and you get documentation that stays in sync with your routes: params, request body, response types.
- **Try it in the browser** – Send real requests, edit params, headers, and body, and see responses in the UI. No Postman required for day-to-day debugging or sharing with your team.
- **Lightweight** – No external services. Run the docs UI locally or mount it under a path like `/tracelet-docs`. Optional JWT auth keeps the docs private when you need it.

Everything is driven from **your running application**—same source of truth for code, logs, and docs.

## Key features

- **Logging & tracking** – Log HTTP requests with route context, payload shapes, and response status. The core Logger creates request/tracing IDs and handles formatting (dev vs prod, JSON vs readable).
- **Route metadata** – Describe your API with a simple structure: method, path, request/response properties, query and path params. Merge file-based meta with in-code meta; the SDK resolves nested routes and full paths.
- **Built-in docs UI** – Routes sidebar, API details panel with Params, Body, Headers, Authorization, and Response. Persist choices per route and try different content types.
- **Optional auth** – When `TRACELET_DOC_USERNAME` and `TRACELET_DOC_PASSWORD` are set, the docs UI shows a login dialog and uses JWT for the docs endpoints only (not for your API routes).

## See it in action

The Tracelet docs UI gives you a route list and a details panel where you can edit inputs and send requests.

## Optional auth

When you set `TRACELET_DOC_USERNAME` and `TRACELET_DOC_PASSWORD`, the docs UI shows a sign-in dialog before allowing access. Auth uses JWT and applies only to the docs endpoints (e.g. the routes list); your API routes are unchanged.

From here you can explore the [Express SDK](/docs/sdk/express/get-started) to add Tracelet to your app, or the [Core SDK](/docs/sdk/core/get-started) if you only need logging and metadata without the docs UI.
