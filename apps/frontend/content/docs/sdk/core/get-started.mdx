## Install

Install only `@tracelet/core` from a `.tgz` tarball (or from npm when published).

<CodeBlockTabs
  npm="npm install ./tracelet-core-0.0.1.tgz"
  yarn="yarn add file:./tracelet-core-0.0.1.tgz"
  pnpm="pnpm add ./tracelet-core-0.0.1.tgz"
  language="bash"
/>

## Use in code

Use `@tracelet/core` for logging and metadata in your app. You integrate it with your own framework or server (no Express required).

```typescript
import { createTraceEvent } from "@tracelet/core";

// Use the core SDK for events, logging, and metadata.
// See @tracelet/core docs for API details.
```

For Express apps with the built-in docs UI, use the **Express** setup instead.

## Running locally

Run your app as usual. The core SDK does not serve a UI; it only provides logging and metadata. For the docs UI, use the **Express** setup.

## Troubleshooting

### "Tracelet UI not found. Build the UI or set uiPath."

Does not apply to Core. This message is for the Express setup only.

### "Could not fetch routes" / connection error

Only relevant when using the docs UI (Express). For Core-only, ensure your app runs and the SDK is configured correctly.

### UI 404 or blank at /tracelet-docs

Only applies to Express. Core does not serve a UI.
