## Install

Install `@tracelet/express` from a `.tgz` tarball (or from npm when published). It depends on `@tracelet/core` (installed automatically).

<CodeBlockTabs
  npm="npm install @tracelet/express"
  yarn="yarn add @tracelet/express"
  pnpm="pnpm add @tracelet/express"
  language="bash"
/>

The docs UI is bundled inside `@tracelet/express`. You do not need to install `@tracelet/ui` or set `uiPath` unless you want to override the default.

## Use in code

Plug Tracelet into your Express app and mount the docs UI so your team can see routes, logs, and test endpoints.

```typescript
import express from "express";
import { useTracelet, traceletDoc } from "@tracelet/express";

const app = express();

useTracelet(app, { serviceName: "my-app", environment: "dev" });

// Your routes and route meta (TraceletMeta[])...
const meta = [/* ... */];

traceletDoc(app, meta);

app.listen(3000);
```

`useTracelet` enables request/response logging and metadata. `traceletDoc` serves the docs UI and `GET /tracelet-docs?json=true` for route meta. Open `/tracelet-docs` in the browser to use the UI.

### Custom UI path

To serve a different build of the docs UI, pass `uiPath`:

```typescript
traceletDoc(app, meta, {
  path: "/tracelet-docs",
  uiPath: "/absolute/path/to/your/ui/dist",
});
```

## Running locally

Run your app as usual. The docs UI is served by Express at `/tracelet-docs` (or your chosen path). No separate dev server unless you are customizing the UI.

### Single server (recommended)

Start your app. Open `http://localhost:3000/tracelet-docs`. The UI fetches route meta from the same origin; no env vars needed.

### UI on a different origin

If the docs UI is served from another port (e.g. a separate Vite app), set `TRACELET_DOC_API_ROUTE` to your API base URL (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`) so the UI can call `/tracelet-docs?json=true`.

## Troubleshooting

### "Tracelet UI not found. Build the UI or set uiPath."

Only applies to Express. If you installed from a .tgz, the pack may have been created before the UI was built. Re-pack after a full build, or set `uiPath` to a directory that contains `index.html`.

### "Could not fetch routes" / connection error

Ensure your API is running and `GET /tracelet-docs?json=true` returns JSON (array of route meta). If the UI is on another origin, set `TRACELET_DOC_API_ROUTE`.

### UI 404 or blank at /tracelet-docs

Check that `traceletDoc` is mounted and that the bundled UI or `uiPath` contains `index.html`.
