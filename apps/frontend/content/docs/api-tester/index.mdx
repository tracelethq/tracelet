## Overview

The **API tester** panel lets you send real HTTP requests to your API and see responses. It works the same for every SDK (Express, Core, or any future SDK). Each part of the UI has its own doc with tables and examples.

## Fields and tabs

| Doc | What it covers |
|-----|----------------|
| [Request](/docs/api-tester/request) | What "request" means: URL, method, params, body, content type, and how they're sent. |
| [Response](/docs/api-tester/response) | How the response is shown: status, duration, body, and headers. |
| [Request content type](/docs/api-tester/request-content-type) | Choosing `application/json` vs `multipart/form-data` for the body. |
| [Params](/docs/api-tester/params) | Path and query parameters: how to fill them and supported types. |

Use these when you need a precise explanation of one field (e.g. request content type or params) with examples.
