## Request content type

**Request content type** is the `Content-Type` header used when sending the request body. You choose it in the **Body** tab.

### Supported types

| Type | When to use | Body tab behavior |
|------|-------------|--------------------|
| **application/json** | JSON APIs (most REST). | Keys and values are sent as a JSON object. |
| **multipart/form-data** | Form uploads, file uploads. | Each row is a form field; **File** rows send the selected file(s). |

If route meta sets **requestContentType**, the UI uses it and shows it as a badge. Otherwise you pick from the dropdown (choice is remembered per route). When any Body row is type **File**, the UI forces **multipart/form-data**.

### Examples

**JSON body (application/json):**

| Key | Value |
|-----|--------|
| name | Alice |
| email | alice@example.com |

Sent as: `{"name":"Alice","email":"alice@example.com"}`

**Form with file (multipart/form-data):**

| Key | Type | Value |
|-----|------|--------|
| title | String | My document |
| file | File | document.pdf (chosen via picker) |

Sent as multipart form fields; the file is uploaded as a part.
